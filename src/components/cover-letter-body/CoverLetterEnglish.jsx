      <article> 
            It was a pleasure reading about your app, downloading the beta version, and trying it out. The concept is great, I would apply it to so many other things. 
                I love the idea of ​​gamifying it and my head has not stopped thinking about what else could be done, but surely you have already thought about everything.</article>
      <article> For many years I did martial arts and the pleasure of concentrating on your activity, have a routine, control your breathing, to overcome your limits, mental strength... 
                Although I am not a very avid runner lately, <span> (for health, weight and time limit reasons)</span> I understand the pleasure that one can feel with it perfectly and 
                even though it is an individual pleasure, like all pleasures, sometimes sharing it makes them much better. </article>
      <article> Maybe we can help each other... I still have things to practice and learn and I'm looking forward to applying the knowledge I've gained in the real world. I would like to 
                know more about my work and come to an understanding of whether we are a good match for each other. </article>
      <article>Thanks for your time. I hope we can talk soon.</article>
